# AWS Systems Management (SSM) Getting Started Scenario

## Introduction
This AWS Systems Manager (SSM) getting started scenario demonstrates how to interact with the AWS Systems Manager service using the AWS SDK. The scenario covers various operations such as creating a maintenance window, creating an SSM document, sending a command to a managed node, creating an OpsItem, updating an OpsItem, and deleting SSM resources.

## Service Operations Invoked
The program performs the following tasks:

1. Creates an SSM maintenance window.
2. Modifies the maintenance window by changing the schedule.
3. Creates an SSM document that defines the actions Systems Manager performs on managed nodes.
4. Sends a command to an EC2 instance using the created SSM document.
5. Retrieves the time when the specific command was sent to the managed node.
6. Creates an SSM OpsItem to track and manage an operational issue.
7. Updates the created OpsItem and gets the status.
8. Resolves the OpsItem.
9. Optionally deletes the created SSM resources (maintenance window and document).

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the Java source code file.
2. Open the code in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Update the following variables in the `main()` method:
   - `instanceId`: The ID of the EC2 instance to send the command to.
   - `title`: The title of the OpsItem to create.
   - `source`: The source of the OpsItem.
   - `category`: The category of the OpsItem.
   - `severity`: The severity of the OpsItem.
4. Run the `SSMScenario` class.

The program will guide you through the scenario, prompting you to enter the maintenance window name and the document name. The program will also display the progress and results of the various operations.

## Code Explanation
The provided code demonstrates the following key features of the AWS SDK for Java (v2) and the AWS Systems Manager service:

1. **Maintenance Window Management**: The code uses the `SsmClient` to create, modify, and delete an SSM maintenance window.
2. **SSM Document Management**: The code creates an SSM document that defines the actions Systems Manager performs on managed nodes.
3. **Command Execution**: The code sends a command to an EC2 instance using the created SSM document and retrieves the timestamp of the command execution.
4. **OpsItem Management**: The code creates, updates, and resolves an SSM OpsItem to track and manage an operational issue.
5. **Error Handling**: The code includes exception handling for various SSM-related exceptions.
6. **User Interaction**: The code prompts the user for input, such as the maintenance window name and the document name.

Overall, this Java V2 AWS Systems Manager code example is a resource for developers new to AWS Systems Manager and the AWS SDK for Java (v2). It provides a solid foundation for understanding and building applications that interact with the AWS Systems Manager service.
